# Post-Project Reflection
During this project I had huge struggles with wireframing databases. This proved to be a big issue as I had troubles with distractions but I have definitely learned a bunch. Some growth areas I have improved on is understanding these concepts of databases, routing, and how front-end is linked to both back-end and databases. I think the biggest takeaway though is by the time I realized it I was struggling with a few days left and took it in myself to ask for help, instead of giving up. I hope to ask for help more instead of trying to power through it.
